# About me

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Jeonbuk Nnational University, Korea. My main fields of research are in Labour Economics and Applied Microeconomics. In my work I apply causal inference methods to study issues on job stabilization fund(wage subsidy) and minimum wage. I'm currently visiting Universidad Carlos III de Madrid from 2024 Fall.
